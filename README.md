## Microservices 1

**MERN Stack Webapp with postgresql and mongodb as the database. To store and retrieve data.**

## Microservices 2

**Django Machine learing model with it's api and SQLite3 as a development database for hassle free database modeling of Machine learning prediction.**

Stage 1: Defining the use of this Webapp.

Stage 2: Designing frontend and its Backend Architecture Database Schema in both One Tier and Two tier using some presentation software.

Stage 3: Working on Code Solution.

Stage 4: Deployment of Project.

Django Template is ready with it's REST API file setup.

React App template is also ready.

Backend will be powered by Express for react.

Django will be used to deploy the Machine learning model and it's REST API for data prediction and the predicted data will be store in SQLite and Postgresql database of Microservices 1.

Basically i have a plan to keep a copy of data stored in SQLite from postgresql. So that i can use it in development later on.
